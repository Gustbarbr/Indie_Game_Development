## LORE

### A kingdom named Aldrica
In ancient times, there was a prosperous and powerful kingdom called **Aldrica**. Within this kingdom, the royal family ruled, composed of the king, the queen, and a pair of siblings.
The older sister was a master of swordsmanship, so skilled that she could easily defeat even the general of the royal army. The younger brother, on the other hand, was well-versed in magic, having been taught by the kingdom’s wisest mages since childhood.

### The Evil Call
One day, the prince began to exhibit strange behavior, which caught the king's attention. Concerned, the king ordered the royal mages to investigate. They discovered that the prince had encountered a peculiar-looking individual who encouraged him to seek more power through dark magic.
Enraged, the king ordered the prince to be watched and isolated. However, the mysterious figure appeared at the kingdom’s gates and destroyed them with a single spell, initiating a massacre all the way to the castle.

### The Fusion Ritual
The stranger freed the prince and proposed a fusion ritual that would grant ultimate power, at the cost of the kingdom. The prince accepted, and the kingdom was devastated—everyone killed, except for his sister who was returning from battle.
During the ritual, the princess and part of the army returned to find the ruins. Mistaking the stranger as the sole culprit, she threw her spear at him, interrupting the ritual.

### Separated
Instead of merging, both the prince and the stranger were torn apart and their bodies scattered. Their fused hearts landed in a mystical forest.

### The Rise of the Undead
Forest dwellers buried the heart, believing it to belong to a fallen adventurer. However, the heart fused with the earth and possessed the body of a powerful buried mage. Seeking to recover its body, the undead being began corrupting the forest and raising the dead.

### The Last Hope
The forest dwellers turned to their most powerful warrior—**Layla**, a druid attuned to magic and nature. She now sets out to confront the darkness and uncover the truth behind the undead rising in her home.



## DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
An elf druid defends her forest using bow and arrow, along with summonable creatures of nature, against the dark forces of a necromancer who is corrupting the forest with his army of undead. The player will explore the forest, which at first will have few enemies and more vegetation, but as the journey progresses the forest will become more corrupt, with less vegetation and more undead walking through it. The player's goal is to explore the forest, grow stronger and face the bosses that are scattered throughout the map, in order to prevent the forest from being destroyed by the necromancer.

## GAME MECHANICS
The player will have a safe space in a village within the forest, and in this village there will be a blacksmith who can improve the bow, an alchemist who can sell potions and poisons and also a sage who can strengthen and sell new spells. 
As for gameplay, the player will be able to shoot with his bow and arrows, which have infinite ammunition, which consumes stamina; dodge and jump, consuming stamina; heal himself using healing potions, fill a part of his mana bar using mana potions, fill a part of the stamina using stamina potions; summon forest beings, such as animals and treants, using a part of the mana, depending on the summoning. 
The potions have limited uses, and it is necessary to allocate vials for the desired status (health, mana and stamina). The player starts with 3 and can have up to 5. It is possible to allocate between 0 and 5 per status. The initial allocation is 1 vial per status and at the resting point it is possible to reallocate. 
By defeating enemies, the player will gain experience that can be used to level up at a resting spot. Enemies can also drop coins and materials that can be used at the village merchants. Resting spots restore health, mana, reset enemies, and allow fast travel. When exiting and entering a stage, enemies, with the exception of bosses, respawn.
